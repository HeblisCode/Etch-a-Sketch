# Etch-a-Sketch Project

### [Live Preview](https://hebliscode.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/) <br>

This simple game will let you draw on a grid by overing the mouse cursor. <br>
There are 5 different color modes:

- Black
- Rainbow
- Lighten: increase the cell background lightness by 10%
- Darken: decrease the cell background lightness by 10%
- Color picker: pick your favorite color!

The code.js file contains all the code that makes the game working while lib.js contains some functions used for color format conversion.
